This branch is an experimental check to base the repository
on activites instead tasks.

Tasks are base data used to reference activites. Activities are
timestamps referring to tasks. Activities can be sorted and listed
in many ways, where summing up the tasks is only one of them.

See concept.txt in this branch for the way things are implemented here.
